# Crypsure Plugin Demo

A demo of the Crypsure payment plugin. It's a straightforward e-commerce site with a few categories and example products.

## Plugin Dependency

Until stabilized, this project relies on a local link to the `@crypsure/plugin` [library](https://github.com/crypsure/crypsure-plugin), which it expects at the relative path `../plugin`.

## Usage

This project is build on Vue3, Vite, and Postcss. We recommend PNPM instead of NPM to save time and disk space.

**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Run**
```
npm run dev
```

**Build**
```
npm run build
```
